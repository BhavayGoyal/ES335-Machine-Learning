## Decision Tree Classifier Performance from `classification-exp.py`

### A)
- Accuracy: 53.33%
- Class:
    - 1:
        - Precision: 0.5217
        - Recall: 0.8
    - 2:
        - Precision: 0.5714
        - Recall: 0.2667

### B)
- Fold 1:
    - Depth: 8
    - Accuracy: 0.7

- Fold 2:
    - Depth: 6
    - Accuracy: 0.75

- Fold 3:
    - Depth: 8
    - Accuracy: 0.75

- Fold 4:
    - Depth: 6
    - Accuracy: 0.8

- Fold 5:
    - Depth: 7
    - Accuracy: 0.95

- Depth 6 and 8 are chosen two times each, but Depth 6 has higher average accuracy than Depth 8 (0.775 vs 0.725). 
- Hence optimum depth is 6
